    "# Busiest Flight Routes \n",
    "In this assignment, you'll play the role of a freelance analyst for TravelAire, a boutique travel firm. They're preparing for a busy travel season, and have put together a list of the flights they expect will be most popular. While the CSV contains data such as destination and arrival airports as well as number of passengers in previous years, it does not contain the median price of a ticket for each of these popular routes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The travel firm has therefore asked that you use the Amadeus Flights API to augment this list with the most up-to-date price information for each route. Specifically, they want you to calculate the median ticket price for each route, and afterwards, would like for you to compare the average ticket cost of domestic routes with international routes in this dataset. The firm is hoping to use this information to better plan their marketing efforts for the upcoming season\n",
    "In order to complete this assignment, you will: \n",
    "- Connect to the Amadeus API \n",
    "- Load your CSV of Busiest Flight Routes data into a data frame \n",
    "- Write a function that will retrieve a list of flight offers based on the origin and destination airports \n",
    "- Write a function that will compute a median price from a given list of flight offers \n",
    "- Use the above functions to retrieve the median ticket price for each route in your CSV and update the data frame \n",
    "- Compare the average of all median domestic prices to the average of all median international flights\n",
    "\n",
    "This is arguably the most difficult assignment in the term. Take your time, review your notes, and collaborate with your fellow peers!\n"

    "- `BusiestFlightRoutes.csv`\n",

    "- **Expected Output**. \n",
    "  - Many unfinished code cells will have output below them. You will be expected to write code that produces the same output.\n",
    "  - Some unfinished code cells do _not_ have output below them. This is simply because not all code will generate output. Your solutions for these cells should _not_ print anything.\n",

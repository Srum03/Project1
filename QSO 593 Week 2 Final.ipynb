    "In this assignment, you will play the role of an analyst at a retail wholesaler. The company has rolled out a brand-new data collection initiative in order to better understand its customers, and theyâ€™ve recently collected information about their most popular products.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While the data collected is accurate, everything is terribly formatted. Your task is to clean up this data so that other members of the team can properly analyze it. Below is a description of the columns of data in this CSV and the current formatting issues that you will need to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Product Name`\n",
    "  - **Description**: Contains the name of each product.\n",
    "  - **Problem**: Product names have mixed casing, extra padding, and, in some cases, random hyphens.\n",
    "    - **Example**:  `\"   ---- iPhone \"`, instead of `\"iPhone\"`\n",
    "- `Customer Name`\n",
    "  - **Description**: Contains name of the customer who ordered the product.\n",
    "  - **Problem**: Customer names are all lower cased, but should be title cased. They also have extra padding.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\" jane smith     \"` instead of `\"Jane Smith\"`\n",
    "- `Product Price`\n",
    "  - **Description**: Contains the price of each product.\n",
    "  - **Problem**: Prices are imported as strings, but should be `float` values. In addition, some are negative, but should be positive.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\"-149.22\"` instead of `149.22`\n",
    "- `Quantity Sold`\n",
    "  - **Description**: Number of units of each product sold.\n",
    "  - **Problem**: Quantities sold are imported as strings, but should be `int` values. Like `Product Price`, some of these values are negative, but should be positive.\n",

    "- `sales_data.csv`\n",

    "- **Unfinished Code Cells**\n",

    "  - Cells will contain either starter code for you to finish, or a comment explaining what your code should do.\n",
    "- **Expected Output**. \n",
    "  - Many unfinished code cells will have output below them. You will be expected to write code that produces the same output.\n",
    "  - Some unfinished code cells do _not_ have output below them. This is simply because not all code will generate output. Your solutions for these cells should _not_ print anything.\n",

    "- `sales_data_SOLUTION.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your completed Jupyter Notebook will be this file, but with all of the problems solved. One of these problems will require you to generate a file called `sales_data_SOLUTION.csv`, which you will also submit.\n",

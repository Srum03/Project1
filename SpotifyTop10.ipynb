    "# Analyzing Spotify Music Data\n",
    "In this assignment, you are a business analyst at an event management company that specializes in concerts. In an effort to identify potential performers, youâ€™ve been tasked to analyze Spotify data on songs that have appeared in their top 10 list from 2010-2015. For each year in the dataset, you will need to complete three analysis problems. Rather than manually repeating each analysis for each individual year, you will write three distinct functions that can be reused for each year.\n",

    "The CSV contains the following columns: \n",
    "- Song title\n",
    "- Artist\n",
    "- Year \n",
    "- Popularity; i.e. the number of times the song was played \n",
    "- Subgenre\n",
    "\n",
    "You will begin by loading your CSV, converting it to a dictionary spreadsheet, and performing simple data cleansing. Then for each year, from 2010 through 2015, you will need to find:\n",
    "- How many songs appear in the top 10 \n",
    "- The average popularity of songs that appear in the top 10 \n",
    "- How many songs in each of the following genres - dance pop, hip hop - appear in the top 10 "

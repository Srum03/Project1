    "In this assignment, you'll play the role of lead analyst for a credit card provider.¬†You‚Äôve been provided with a CSV file that provides information on both customers who have churned and customers who still use the credit card. You have been tasked to determine whether churned vs. existing customers show significant differences when it comes to the following factors:\n",

    "- Number of dependents \n",
    "- Total Revolving balance; i.e. the balance that still needs to be paid \n",

    "The first three metrics are numeric so you will apply the same strategies to solve those problems. Customer income is categorical so you will be applying a slightly different strategy to solve that problem.\n",
